### Criteria:

With a team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
